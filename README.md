# Digita-Field-Geoscience

Digital field mapping methods are ubiquitous in modern field-based geoscience practice. This repository will capture best practices for digital fieldwork data collection including methods, standards, and geoscience community and public via a Wiki. The aim is to capture and publish current state-of-the-art of knowledge, data repositories, software, and other resources. The Wiki will remain openly accessible for the community to contribute to and expand as new technologies become available, and methods adapt.
